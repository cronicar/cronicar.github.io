It is said that civilizations grow around rivers, and it is no different in Africa. Egypt, Nubiaand Axum (Ethiopia) sprang up around the Nile River. Egypt grew to be one of the most easily recognizable countries in the world with it's pyramids and mummies. It was conquered many times by different civilizations icluding the Romans and finally adopted Islam after the Muslim invasion. The civilization of Nubia though quickly faltered notwithstanding the grips of time. Ethiopia is a unique country, not only for it's incredible landscapes but also for the fact that it has remained a sovreign nation through it's entire history. Sure it was occupied but never quite annexed to any other country. Way to go! Originally Islamic based it is now a Christian nation. But 3 countries do not make up all of Africa. Countless tribes wandered, fought and lived on this amazing continent, but sadly their history is lost. Their lifestyle was discovered by the Europeans who came to colonise but by then it didn't matter, Africa was carved up like a pie and served to the various European nations. The colonies they formed were the foundations for the countries we have today. This, is Africa.
