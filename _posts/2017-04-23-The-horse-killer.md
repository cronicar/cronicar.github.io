Hello, my name is Beak. I am, or was a vagabond owl. When i used to wander around, i came by a nice little village. The mayor **magnanimously** decided to give four wonderful **stallion**s as prizes from his own herd. One each week to a lucky villager. On the first week Arrow, a chocolate brown Thoroughbred, swift of foot, hence his name. He was put in his separate stable for the next day when the winner would be declared. When the day came the townsfolk found in horror that Arrow had apparently died of **asphyxiation** and had been skinned. The next week an Andalusian named Silverhoof was put in a locked stable but the same thing happened again. In despair the mayor put guards around Hawk a shiny black mustang. In the night Hawk bolted and ran for the hills and is probably with roving mustang herds now. The guards found a tunnel inside the stable but it led to the woods and they returned to the village. The mayor held a town meet and said that this was a **recurring** happening that was an **improper** way to treat horses and cheated villagers out of horses that they could have won. So on the fourth week. Water, a peculiar blue Shire horse was hidden in the **landfills** and armed men were stationed in the rafters of his stable. At midnight a middle aged man creeped in with a thick rope. He was immediately jumped on and beaten to the ground. They went to his house and found the horse skins ready for shipping to a black market to sell them. He had **cunningly** strangled the horses and skinned them under the cover of night. His sentence was to repay the town for the lost horses. Water went to an old farmer who was down on his luck and they immediately became friends.
