Time is a very valuable resource. You will never get it back, this is why it is so important to not waste it. I would like to point out three things we can do to use our time better. First of we shouldn't do absoluetly pointless things. If it does have a purpose like having fun or exercise, it's ok. But "killing time" is not a valid purpose. Don't stand in a line so long that it isn't worth what you would get from that line. If you want to take a break from working or studying don't twiddle your thumbs(Unless that truly is fun for you) but read a book or take a walk. It is also very important to budget your time or set a goal so that you do not take to long doing something. If you have an idea about how much time you are willing to alocate to what you are doing you will not drag out the task too long. Most importantly decide if what you are doing is worth it. If it's not, don't do it. If you think it is, go for it. But all in all, don't be constantly worrying about wasting time. That to is a time-waster.:)
