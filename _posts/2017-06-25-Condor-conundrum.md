The condor sat on a **bough** overlooking a canyon. His only meal today a **mere** mouse he had found dead. Other birds were fed by the people who travelled through the canyon, but not him. They regarded him as a **herald** of death. This didn’t bother him as much as often being the **subject** of shouts and insults. The eagle was regarded as **sublime** because it killed and not scavenged. “Really?” thought the condor. “He is so annoying with his manner of speech always saying **ken** instead of understand or know. But the humans don’t speak with him so they aren’t bothered. And just because of one **datum** about a condor attack I was chased out of my canyon.
