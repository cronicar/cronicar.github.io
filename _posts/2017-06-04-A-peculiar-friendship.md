As I was travelling I came to a rural village on the plains. The people were very friendly there and made me feel at home. But the most interesting thing about the village was an im**probable** **friendship** between two animals in the village. A **lithe** wildcat that sometimes came to feed in the village and a small sparrow colored greenish-grey. Originally the sparrow had **vacillate**d when the wildcat had offered it part of itâ€™s food. But slowly they had become friends even once a **trace** of grain was found from the village storehouse to the hiding spot of the wildcat. They were such good friends the villagers joked saying they were **humiliating** the other cats and birds in the village. There they were both feasting on a bag of grain. But it was **axiomatic** that this **friendship** would have to cease during winter when the swallow must fly south for the winter. When the time came the swallow chirped a **valedictory** speech and the wildcat set about waiting for spring.
