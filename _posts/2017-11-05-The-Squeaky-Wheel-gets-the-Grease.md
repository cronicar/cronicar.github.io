Have you ever heard the saying "The squeaky wheel gets the grease"? people who complain or voice their needs are more likely to get what they want. while this might work in some cases it is also not always a good approach. if you complain you will be percieved in a bad light. And if you are in a group and you are constantly complaining then you might not be as welcome in that group. But contrary to "The squeaky wheel gets the grease" a japanese proverb says "The nail that sticks out shall be hammered down" So if you are constantly complaining about something you might be shunned insttead of given what you want. Both of these proverbs say the truth. It is good to voice your wants but don't be a nuisance and be constantly whining and complaining.
