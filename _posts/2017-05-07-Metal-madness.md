I will proceed to tell quite a **disquieting** tale about a **careworn** **carpenter**. The **carpenter** was a peculiar sort, wasn’t from around here. You must understand, in our small mining community everyone knew everyone. Strangers weren’t too welcome. He was a **commuter**, travelled a long way to get to our village and work. He didn’t seem to have any **affiliation**, no one knew where he was from. He made mostly mining tools. Pickaxes and the like. But one day he decided to try his luck for himself believing that a better fortune could be made mining than making mining tools. 3 whole days he stayed out at the mining site, people thought he had died. On the fourth he came back yelling like a lunatic. He said he had found the mother-**lode** of gold. A streak of gold hundreds of meters long! The whole village followed him to the spot and it was true! But alas, it was only pyrite. His **embarrassment** was great. He sullenly trudged home. On days following he babbled continuously about gold. It was the **subject** of his every discussion. One day he just disappeared. An inspection of his home revealed countless chunks of pyrite with “GOLD” carved onto each one. A look at the **lode** of pyrite revealed only a dead wolf. What had happened we villagers didn’t know.
