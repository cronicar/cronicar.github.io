A funny little thing happened a few weeks ago. I was **charter**ing a flight to go to Costa Rica for a few days when a **delinquent** came into my office. He looked a bit shady and it surprised me when he said “I **bet** you can’t **bunt** a baseball!”. I was a bit taken aback by the remark but even more so when he said “I **bet** you a **carved**  **trinket** to $10 that you can’t” Well here my honour was at stake so i took up the deal even though it was not a good deal and i had no need of a **trinket**. We arranged that on Sunday afternoon we would meet in the park and he would throw 3 baseballs one after the other and i would have to **bunt** one to win. So on Sunday I went to the park and got my baseball bat and looked around. He wasn’t there! I waited for half an hour and then i went home.But what a surprise when i got home my office was **demolished** and the computer was missing! I panicked and quickly dialed the police. Luckily they managed to catch that bum but from now on i will not make weird **bet**s with people i don’t know.
