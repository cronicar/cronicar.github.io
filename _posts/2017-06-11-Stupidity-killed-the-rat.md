**Common sense** was lacking in the rat tribe of subway terminal 46. A great **vice** was their lack of thought before going into skirmishes or forage trips. It was **becoming** more and more difficult to get food as the days wore on. Many **disconcerted** rats **manifest**ed their displeasure but did nothing about it. A battle against a tribe of stoats was lost over a bread crust with a leaf of salad on it. The rats decided a new home was imperative to the survival of their tribe. They found in an old abandoned alley a tarp stretched over some wood planks. To their great pleasure they found the tarp **waterproof**. Their **conjectures** were that because the alley seemed empty it was empty. This lack of thought ultimately led to their demise when a group of cats stalked up in the night and gobbled most of the rats up. As the rest of the rats fled they encountered the tribe of stoats they had fought earlier on who was still quite unhappy about the scuffle a few days back. The rat tribe was soon just a pile of fur and bones in an alley.
