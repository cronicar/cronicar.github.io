Welcome to Bernardâ€™s **Bouquet** Blog and the results are in for the weirdest **trepidation** of the week. Someone has sent in a story of someone they know is afraid of **corduroys**. Yes, that is correct. Needing an **outlet** to vent his fury this man grabbed some **corduroys**, **entangled** them but then fell into a manhole. As the day was extremely hot and the man displayed a **lethargy** to try and get out. When  he finally was rescued he was **transfigured**. Dirty and bruised, and a bit insane too. This submission was **editorialized** with a note laughing at his fear but if you had fallen into a manhole for hours due to some pants, you might feel the same.
