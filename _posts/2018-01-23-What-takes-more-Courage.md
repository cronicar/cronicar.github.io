So, what takes more courage? to cover up your flaws and in the face of danger be brave and face whatever you come up against? Or is it admitting to your flaws and recognizing that you are not very good at something? Or is courage not having any fear at all? Well to be courageous you must overcome your fears and perservere even if you are afraid that is what makes you courageous, so it is definetely not not having fear. And if it is braving through your fears in a seemingly unafraid manner then it is definetely the first option! But no, it could be in some cases but also afraid of seeming incompetentin front of others. So if both of the options are confronting fears which requires more courage? You might have a different opinion than me but I think that even though it can be percieved extremely brave to put on a brave face and do what needs to be done, (usually in an emergency) it is usually spurred by neccesity and oftentimes we do not give it a second thought and just jump to it. Recognizing your flaws on the other hand, you know full well what you are doing and you know others may think less of you. Even if usually your brain exaggerates and says that everyone will hate you it still takes a lot of courage to admit to not being as good. Especially if you were thought very good at said thing beforehand. I think this takes true courage.
