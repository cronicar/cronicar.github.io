There are so many things in the world. Everyone has been in a store, seen something and has wanted to buy it because either its "cool" or "I'll need it later" But most likely you can live without it. I try to cut back on small expenses as much as possible. I don't buy everything that catches my eye in the store. You just don't need those kind of things in your life. And I usually eat at home than at a restaurant or fastfood. Eating out is okay but it is also expensive. When I recieve money as a gift I save it for later not spending it all the next day. I also don't try to be always up to date with the latest trend. AS with most trends they are expensive and go away quickly, then a new trend starts and so on. Overall, there are many small expenses and we can do without most, it saves money and time from sorting through all that junk you bought.
