It was a sunny morning. Not a cloud in the sky when the man came to the village. He bought two chunks of land and commenced to build on one of them. The other lay vacated for over a month. Then one day a group of children went up to the plot of land and started digging a swimming pool. After they had dug it they started paving the bottom with rocks and such. As the man went for a **stroll** he saw what was happening on his land and immediately went to the court in the village and demanded that they issue an **injunction** immediately. The court wished to comply but then they realized that they didn’t know how! The man was furious. He **postulate**d that a court had to be able to issue an **injunction** or else it was a **bogus** court.One of the children had been eavesdropping and raced to tell the others. The children’s **euphoria** when they heard the news was great and they commenced work on the pool with more vigour than before. The man was **obdurate** and persisted that the court stop the pool being built. The court was tired of “The Fool” as they called him and told him that it was not **relevant** to their duties. Finally the man buckled and sold the properties and left town. No one wanted the empty lot in which the children had built the pool. Its ownership went to the group of children who had thought up the project. The children organized a committee and charged for usage of the pool so they could have some extra pocket money.
