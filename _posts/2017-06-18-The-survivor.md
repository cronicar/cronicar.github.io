Grimepaw searched in the alley for no **avail**. The **unrelenting** hunger gnawed at his stomach as he moved on to the next alley. For many animals it was a **famine**, the cityfolk had organized a clean-up crew to get rid of food scraps on the ground. For Grimepaw it was especially hard as he was only a **naif**, just born when his tribe had been wiped out. He was abandoned in the terminal due to how young he was. Nevertheless he was growing up to be quite a large rat. It seemed that **biennial**ly he doubled in size. He was now almost the size of a cat, and due to the desperate times an excellent fighter. His coat pure black, he could go unseen in the dark. On this day so it happened that while searching for something to eat he encountered a group of stoats also foraging for food. At a growl of **assent** from the foremost stoat the others leaped to fight Grimepaw. But Grimepaw had other plans, he charged the leader stoat guarding the food they had accumulated and entered a furious melee of tooth and claw with the leader. The stoat made an **element**al mistake when he exposed his belly to Grimepaw. He quickly dispatched the stoat and ran of with a slice of half-eaten ham. As he sat down to enjoy his meal later on in the evening he thought of his clan.
